          <p class="intro">Commissioning a piece of beautiful, handmade furniture is an exciting and rewarding experience. You will become the owner of a unique piece, made to the highest standards and to your requirements. Working closely with John, you will be involved with design, timber choices and finish.</p>
          <p>As a starting point, we are pleased to receive enquiries by phone or email to discuss your initial ideas. Once you've had a look through the <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a> which shows a broad range of previous commissions,  a meeting can be arranged with John to discuss your idea further.</p>
          <p>Bespoke furniture cannot, by definition, be rushed. Unique designs, well seasoned timber, quality fittings and considered finish all require time and expertise. Traditional methods of construction and hand tools are used alongside modern to create furniture that will last for generations to come. No compromise is always at the forefront of the decision making process.</p>

          <h1>Why commission a piece of furniture?</h1>
          <p>You have good idea of what your piece needs to achieve. You may have a mental picture of it. You have searched high and low, but to no avail. What you find is either too big, too small, almost the right colour, but not quite. You could be disillusioned by the quality and lack of individuality seen in most commercial stores. </p>
          <p>It is time to consider commissioning a furniture maker to create exactly what it is that you are looking for.</p>

          <h1>The commissioning process</h1>
          <p>Commissioning a piece of handmade fine furniture is a very personal, enjoyable and rewarding experience in which the client can take an active role at all stages of the journey from workshop to their home.</p>

          <h3>Initial consultation</h3>
          <p>The initial consultation will usually take place in your home or office and will establish your exact functional requirements, particular features and dimensions for the piece. At this stage if you have particular likes or dislikes they can be discussed and highlighted. Any immediate issues with your ideas may be highlighted. Wood samples and different finishes can be perused. Budget should be discussed early on and the intended location of the furniture will also be viewed. </p>
          <p>You should have a reasonably clear idea of the size, functionality and colour of the piece. A piece of fine furniture made to your requirements will be more expensive than one thatâ€™s factory made. The price of a piece will be determined largely by how complicated the design is. This determines how long it takes to make. Materials used and the finish required will also have bearing on the final cost. The design can be tailored according to your budget. </p>

          <h3>The design phase</h3>
          <p>The design is the collation of all your preferences and requirements, resulting in a piece that is unique to you. As the design evolves, sketches will be provided and a closer calculation of the likely cost. It will fulfill your practical needs. More importantly, a personal piece will be created that you enjoy using, looking at, and just being near. You will understand what is special about its construction.</p>
          <p>A design fee may be payable, this will reflect the costs of visiting you, researching and preparing the design. Particularly for more complex commissions, when models are made and when the client requires extra design options.</p>
